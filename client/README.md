## Getting Started
### To get started, load the page and type in your desired text in either Latin or Greek. Initial load time may take longer than expected due to loading built-in dictionary files. 

### If you don't know either language, here are a few example phrases for you to try out with copy and paste.
    Greek:
        ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε μοῦσα
            The first four words of Homer's Odyssey, "Tell me of a man, Muse..."

    Latin:
        arma virumque cano
            The first three words of Virgil's Aeneid, ""Of arms and the man I sing..."

## After Submit
### You can hover over each word to see its morphology, and if you want a particular word to remain visible, simply click on it.

### Warning!! _If a long phrase is input, expect the phrase to take a while to show up and work properly._

## Please enjoy, and I hope it's in some way helpful in your quest to learn and read the Classical Languages.
