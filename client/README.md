# Project Akhos - A Greek & Latin Morphology Tool

## Getting Started

Hosted Page Link: https://akhos.net/

To get started, type in your desired text in either Latin or Greek.

If you don't know either language, here are a few example phrases for you to try out with copy and paste.

**_Greek:_**
<br>
ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε μοῦσα
<br>
The first words of Homer's Odyssey, "Tell me of a man, Muse..."

**_Latin:_**
<br>
arma virumque cano
<br>
The first words of Virgil's Aeneid, "Of arms and the man I sing..."

### After Submitting

You can hover over each word to see its morphology, and if you want a particular word to remain visible, simply click on it.

_*If a long phrase is input, expect the phrase to take a while to show up and work properly.*_

Please enjoy, and I hope it's in some way helpful in your quest to learn and read the Classical Languages.

### Known Issues

If you are having issues loading a word that you think _**should**_ be easily known, try removing any attached suffixes or particles. Sometimes it will work, as with _**virumque**_ for instance. If you have _\_**que**_ on the end of a Latin word and it's not bringing up the definition, try removing it. The same goes for any other words that aren't in a base form.

There are also some issues with certain words in Greek I have yet to iron out.
