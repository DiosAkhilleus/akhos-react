# Akhos

*Migrating akhos-morphology to React*


This is a tool for students of Greek and Latin.

The tool uses both the Latin and Greek morphology tools from the Perseids project (https://www.perseids.org/)

The WikiMedia REST Api is used to fetch the short definition for the corresponding headword. This service will be kind of hit or miss, depending on input string. For the longer definitions, I used the Perseus Project XML API, which provides more robust lexical entries than the WikiMedia API. The results can sometimes, however, be an overload.

Please enjoy, and I hope it's in some way helpful in your quest to learn and read the Classical Languages.
