# Akhos

This is a tool for students of Greek and Latin.

Akhos uses both the Latin and Greek morphology tools from the Perseids project (https://www.perseids.org/), as well as the WikiMedia REST API and the Perseus Project XML API.

## Getting Started
    To get started, load the page and type in your desired text in either Latin or Greek. 

    If you don't know either language, here are a few example phrases for you to copy and paste.

    Greek:
        ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε μοῦσα
            The first four words of Homer's Odyssey, "Tell me of a man, Muse..."

    Latin:
        cogito ergo sum
            The famous phrase by René Descartes, "I think, therefore I am"

### After Submit
    You can hover over each word to see its morphology, and if you want a particular word to remain visible, simply click on it.

#### Warning
    If a long phrase is input, expect the phrase to take a while to show up and work properly.

#### Please enjoy, and I hope it's in some way helpful in your quest to learn and read the Classical Languages.
