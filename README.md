## Getting Started
    To get started, load the page and type in your desired text in either Latin or Greek. Initial load time may take longer than expected due to loading built-in dictionary files. 

    If you don't know either language, here are a few example phrases for you to copy and paste.

    Greek:
        ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε μοῦσα
            The first four words of Homer's Odyssey, "Tell me of a man, Muse..."

    Latin:
        cogito ergo sum
            The famous phrase by René Descartes, "I think, therefore I am"

### After Submit
    You can hover over each word to see its morphology, and if you want a particular word to remain visible, simply click on it.

#### Warning
    If a long phrase is input, expect the phrase to take a while to show up and work properly.

#### Please enjoy, and I hope it's in some way helpful in your quest to learn and read the Classical Languages.
